# Provide the file path, weights, and impacts
file_path = 'your_dataset.csv'
weights = [w1, w2, w3, ...]  # List of weights for each attribute
impacts = ['+', '-', '+', ...]  # List of impacts for each attribute

# Perform TOPSIS analysis
topsis_result = topsis(file_path, weights, impacts)

# Save the TOPSIS rankings to a CSV file
topsis_result.to_csv('topsis_results.csv', index=False)
